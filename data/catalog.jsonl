The new cargo handling facility promises to set new standards of service and quality not only to the Gulf region, but the wider world.\n\nLocated in the midfield area, HIA´s cargo terminal has a capacity to process 1.4 million tonnes of cargo per year. The two-floor cargo facility incorporates warehouse spaces, Automated Systems / Retrieval Systems mezzanine, offices and shops. The split-level facility covers 55,000 square meters, boasting 11 wide-body Freighter aircraft stands and 42 Airside loading docks.

While we’re just 4 km from Doha International – the airport that has admirably served the country since the 1960s – this is effectively a total change in size, scope and standards. Here’s the story of how this transition was planned and achieved.\n\nThe need\n\nAs Qatar has grown so has its airline – and demand at its airport. Ten years ago just over 5 million people a year passed through. Now that’s closer to 25 million and likely to continue rising rapidly. Even with frequent expansion and refurbishment it has long been evident that Doha International Airport couldn't be the answer the nation needed.\n\nThis is also because Qatar has a spirit of not just delivering but of exceeding. While a new airport with more capacity was the obvious answer it wasn't the chosen one. Instead a plan was created for a new airport that could do more: that could define the future.\n\nDriven by the combined vision of HH Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and Akbar Al Baker, Group Chief Executive of the airport, an ambitious and exciting blueprint was drawn up: for a vast airport on a site a third the size of Doha itself, that would be purpose-built for the world’s largest aircraft, that would be designed to provide the ultimate passenger experience, and that would serve the nation and region for generations to come.\n\nThe design\n\nSpacious and stunning Hamad International Airport is all about flow. The flow of passengers, smooth and seamless. For that reason the airport has an aquatic theme. Many buildings feature a water motif, such as the passenger terminal’s wave-styled roof. The surrounding landscaping uses desert plants irrigated with recycled water. And the private Amiri terminal resembles a billowing sail.\n\nOther landmarks are the Islamic crescent-shaped control tower, visible from Doha; and the mosque, with its towering minaret and awe-inspiring glass dome that resembles a water droplet.\n\nThe main terminal is designed in an oval shape to minimize the distance passengers need to travel – to connect, to board, to disembark, to shop, dine or indeed use any facilities. Despite the huge scale – for example, check-in and retail areas are both around 12 times the size of Doha International Airport – everything is under one roof and cleverly designed to be accessible. Space and light are maximized through skylights and arched columns. There are multiple levels, three concourses and – throughout – a standard of outstanding finish commensurate with Qataris’ love of perfection and quality.\n\nNext to the airport 100 hectares have been set aside for an Airport City – with future commercial development opportunities available such as a free trade zone, office and business park, hotels and a retail mall.\n\nThe project\n\nConstruction began in 2006. The undertaking was immense. For example 60% of the site is land reclaimed from the Arabian Gulf. This involved moving and desalinating 6.5 million cubic meters of waste material for landfill – the largest environmental project the region has ever seen. The first two phases opened in 2014. The third and final phase is now underway.\n\nThe future\n\nHamad International Airport will continue to grow and develop. Once complete, phase 3 will boost our capacity from the current 35 million passengers a year to 53 million.\n\nIn addition the Airport City project will extend and diversify the site’s role within aviation generally.", "tags": ["-", "airport history", "design", "construction", "milestones", "vision"], "content": "Title: Our Story | Type: page | Category: About the Airport | Concourse:  Floor:  | Price range: - | Amenities: - | Keywords: airport history, design, construction, milestones, vision | Synonyms: about hia | Access rules: - | Airline affiliation: - | Hamad International Airport represents a new era: for aviation in Qatar and for the nation.

By the end of 2019, Hamad International Airport (HIA) had served 38,786,422 passengers, which was the most it had reserved in a single year.\n\nThe same year that HIA announced its highest passenger traffic to date, the airport announced its multi-phased expansion plan, increasing the airport’s capacity to more than 58 million passengers annually in Phase A of the project, and increasing the capacity further to more than 60 million passengers per annum after the completion of phase B .\n\nThe following year of 2022 began achieving strong passenger numbers, with HIA announcing that it efficiently served a record high influx of passengers during the winter holiday peak period, handling one million passengers in the first week of January 2020, marking the average of 138,649 passengers in a 24-hour period, which is the most number of passengers handled in a single day. During this period of high passenger influx, HIA went above and beyond maintaining high standards of passenger experience and operational excellence to successfully reducing queuing times at key touchpoints of the airport, with average wait times as low as 1 minute 20 seconds at transfer security and 2 minutes 24 seconds at arrival immigration.\n\nWhile HIA’s impressive passenger traffic flows were interrupted by the worldwide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Qatar’s aviation hub was one of the very few airports which never halted operations. As a result, HIA announced in the first quarter of 2020 an increase of 4.7 percent in the global hub’s cargo activity in comparison to the same quarter the previous year.

By the end of 2019, Hamad International Airport (HIA) had served 38,786,422 passengers, which was the most it had reserved in a single year.\n\nThe same year that HIA announced its highest passenger traffic to date, the airport announced its multi-phased expansion plan, increasing the airport’s capacity to more than 58 million passengers annually in Phase A of the project, and increasing the capacity further to more than 60 million passengers per annum after the completion of phase B .\n\nThe following year of 2022 began achieving strong passenger numbers, with HIA announcing that it efficiently served a record high influx of passengers during the winter holiday peak period, handling one million passengers in the first week of January 2020, marking the average of 138,649 passengers in a 24-hour period, which is the most number of passengers handled in a single day. During this period of high passenger influx, HIA went above and beyond maintaining high standards of passenger experience and operational excellence to successfully reducing queuing times at key touchpoints of the airport, with average wait times as low as 1 minute 20 seconds at transfer security and 2 minutes 24 seconds at arrival immigration.\n\nWhile HIA’s impressive passenger traffic flows were interrupted by the worldwide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Qatar’s aviation hub was one of the very few airports which never halted operations. As a result, HIA announced in the first quarter of 2020 an increase of 4.7 percent in the global hub’s cargo activity in comparison to the same quarter the previous year.

Ultra-modern new stadiums and hotels are spread across the country, alongside a growing infrastructure for the country’s transportation and futuristic technology being implemented within the rising venues.

Its main aviation hub, the award-winning Hamad International Airport (HIA, IATA code: DOH) and its companion Doha International Airport (IATA code: DIA), with a robust Airport Operations Plan, a dedicated Event Management Center and well trained and motivated staff, Qatar’s airports are ready to welcome the world through its gates.\n\nUnderstanding Passenger Demographics and Peak Periods\n\nThe commonality for the love of sports between all the diverse visitors will be extremely evident, with visitors estimated by the Host Country to come from various continents, including 37 percent from the GCC, 26 percent from Europe, 11 percent from the Middle East, 8 percent from North America, 8 percent from Asia, 6 percent from Latin America, and 4 percent from Africa.\n\nThe Host Country, has mapped out peak arrival and departure days for passenger traffic, with peak arrivals expected on the first day, while peak departures expected on the 12th day. It has also categorized passenger groups arriving in Qatar for the FIFA World Cup that include teams, referees, media, dignitaries and spectators, and mapped out passenger flow for each category.\n\nThe Airports Operations Plan\n\nMATAR, the Qatar Company for Airports Operation and Management, also formulated the Airports Operations Plan (AOP) which has been a live document for many years, and the final edition has been issued in June 2022. All the plans for airport operations during the tournament have been thoroughly tested during the FIFA Arab Cup 2021 and have also been peer reviewed by aviation authority bodies and organizations who have previously hosted similar scale events.\n\nThe AOP defines in detail every process and procedure in place for the smooth delivery of the FIFA World Cup.

Travel processes such as check-in, immigration, security, boarding, and baggage handling flow were also included and carefully dissected in the AOP.\n\nEvent Management Center\n\nMeanwhile, MATAR has established an Event Management Centre (EMC), dedicated for all World Cup related airport operations at Hamad International Airport and its companion Doha International Airport (DIA).
